# CutMeshByPlaneGenerator

!syntax description /Mesh/CutMeshByLevelSetGenerator

## Overview

The `CutMeshByLevelSetGenerator` is an extended version of [`CutMeshByPlaneGenerator`](/CutMeshByPlaneGenerator.md). It is used to trim a 3D input mesh based on a given level set `f(x,y,z)`. The portion of the input mesh that is within the level set (i.e., `f(x,y,z)<=0`) is retained, while the portion of the input mesh that is outside the level set (i.e., `f(x,y,z)>0`) is discarded. The input mesh, given by [!param](/Mesh/CutMeshByLevelSetGenerator/input), must be 3D and contain only first-order elements. The level set is specified by [!param](/Mesh/CutMeshByLevelSetGenerator/level_set), which can be interpreted by `FParser` as a function of `x`, `y`, and `z` (i.e., `f(x,y,z)`). The mesh is then smoothed to avert a "zigzag" cut along element boundaries.

Using this mesh generator, a 3D structured mesh defined by a bounding box (e.g., generated by [`GeneratedMeshGenerator`](/GeneratedMeshGenerator.md)) can be subtracted into a 3D mesh with its shape define by a given level set. Such a 3D mesh could be further used as an input of [`XYZDelaunayGenerator`](/XYZDelaunayGenerator.md).

## Methods

`CutMeshByLevelSetGenerator` first converts all elements of the input mesh into `TET4` elements. Next, the `TET4` elements sliced by the level set are further split into `TET4` elements. This mesh generator uses exact the same algorithm as its sibling mesh generator, [`CutMeshByPlaneGenerator`](/CutMeshByPlaneGenerator.md). At the first-order element level, cutting by a plane and cutting by a level set are the same.
